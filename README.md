## 👋 Hi there, I'm Julio Carneiro!

🔍 Aspiring Data Analyst | Strong Business Background

🌱 I’m currently enrolled in an intensive, project-based Data Analytics Bootcamp at the University of Toronto and edX, where I’m learning Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization.

📈 I'm working on projects that involve both real-world and simulated datasets to extract meaninful insights and support data-driven decision-making.

🚀 Current Projects:

* Crowdfunding Project - Extract, Transform and Load: This project focuses on building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL. The goal is to extract data from Excel files, transform it into structured DataFrames, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The project demonstrates skills in data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and database management.

* HR Analytics and Employee Attrition Analysis: This data-driven project will explore employee attrition and its influencing factors using Python, SQL, and data visualization tools. The goal is to analyze key HR metrics, develop predictive models, and visualize actionable insights to support better employee retention strategies.
